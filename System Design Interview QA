System design questions and answers.
These system design questions will test your ability to think at a high level and design systems that are scalable, robust, and maintainable. 

1. Design a modular architecture for a scalable iOS Application. 
When desigining iOS Application which is scalable, maintainable, optimised and testable, follow the modular architecture. 

App has modules, which can be plugin and play effectively. 
Team can handle each modules by implementing, testing features in the module. 
These modules can be reused easily in another project. 
Modules could be sharable as package. Swift Packages. 
Modules are independent and scalable. 
Integration would be easier - dependency injection, providing the public interfaces via protocols. 

2. How would you design a modular architecture for an iOS app to ensure scalability, testability and maintainability?

Usecase: 
A large e-commerce app where different teams work on features like cart, search, and user profile. 

Solution:
- Break the app into feature modules (e.g., SearchModule, CartModule).
- Use Coordinator Pattern to manage navigation between modules.
- Define shared services (e.g., NetworkManager, AnalyticsService) in a Core module.
- Adopt a plugin architecture for independent feature teams.
- Use Swift Package Manager or custom frameworks for modularization.

3. Design an Offline Sync framework.
How would you design a framework to handle offline data synchronization in an iOS app?

Requirements:
  Sync data between a local database and a remote server.
  Handle conflicts, retries, and connectivity issues.

Solutions:
 Use Core Data or Realm for local storage.
 Implement a Queue System to track changes.
 Apply a conflict resolution strategy (e.g., Last Write Wins, Merging Changes).
 Use background tasks to periodically sync data.
 Use Reachability APIs to monitor connectivity.

4.  Real-Time Notifications in an iOS App
How would you design a system for delivering real-time notifications in an iOS app?
Solution:
Use Apple Push Notification Service (APNs) for server-to-device communication.
Implement WebSocket-based messaging for in-app real-time updates.
Ensure notification data is encrypted for security.
Use silent notifications for background updates.
Integrate a fallback mechanism to retry failed notifications.

5. Design a Dynamic Feature Delivery System
How would you design a system that allows delivering new features to users dynamically?

Use Remote Config (e.g., Firebase Remote Config) for feature toggling.
Store features as dynamically loaded modules.
Use a microservices architecture to deliver feature configuration.
Implement a robust fallback mechanism for feature failures.
Use a local cache for feature configurations to minimize API calls.

6. Handle App Configurations Dynamically
How would you design a system for managing dynamic app configurations?

Use a Remote Config Service like Firebase Remote Config.
Provide a fallback to a locally cached configuration in case of server failure.
Implement versioning for configurations to avoid breaking changes.
Ensure configurations are encrypted for security.

7. Design a Social Media Feed
How would you design a system for rendering a real-time social media feed?

- Fetch posts in batches using pagination.
- Use diffable data sources for efficient updates to the feed.
- Implement pull-to-refresh for user-initiated updates.
- Cache posts locally for offline viewing.
- Use WebSockets or polling to fetch real-time updates.

8. Design a Video Streaming App
How would you design a video streaming app like YouTube or Netflix?

- Use AVPlayer for video playback.
- Implement adaptive streaming with HLS to optimize bandwidth usage.
- Cache video segments locally for smoother playback.
- Use CDNs (Content Delivery Networks) for high performance.
- Provide robust error handling for buffering and connection failures.

9. Secure Data Storage in an iOS App
How would you design a secure data storage solution for sensitive user data?

 - Use Keychain for storing credentials and sensitive data.
 - Encrypt files using FileProtection APIs.
 - Avoid storing sensitive data in plaintext or unencrypted databases.
 - Use secure hashing algorithms for passwords (e.g., PBKDF2, SHA256).
 - Implement biometric authentication for accessing sensitive data.

10. Multi-Language support in a Global App
How would you design a system to support multiple languages in an iOS app?

- Use Localizable.strings files for static text.
- Use NSLocalizedString for fetching localized strings dynamically.
- Provide a fallback language if a specific translation is missing.
- Load JSON or XML files from a remote server for dynamic content localization.
- Use Locale APIs to detect the userâ€™s preferred language and region.

11. Optimize Image Loading in a Photo Gallery App
How would you optimize image loading and rendering in a photo gallery app?

- Use lazy loading with UICollectionView or UITableView.
- Cache images locally using URLCache or third-party libraries like SDWebImage.
- Compress images to an optimal resolution before displaying.
- Implement prefetching strategies for smoother scrolling.
- Use background threads for image processing to avoid blocking the main thread.
