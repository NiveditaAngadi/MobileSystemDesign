Clean architecture is a software design philosophy that seperates concerns. 
The main goal is to create a system where business rules are isolated from external concerns like UI and databases. 
In iOS, this means seperating your app into distinct layers with clear responsibilities. 

** The layers of clean architecture in iOS ** 
From innermost to outermost:
1. Domain Layer: Contains business logic and entities. 
2. Application/Use Case Layer: Orchestrates the flow of data between domain and presentation. 
3. Interface Adapters Layer: Converts data between use cases and external formats. 
4. Frameworks and Drivers Layer: External frameworks, UI, databases, web services. 

Benefits:
1. Testability: Each component can be tested in isolation. 
2. Independence from frameworks: Core business logic doesn't depend on UIKit or SwiftUI
3. UI independence: Business rules don't change when the UI changes
4. Database independence: You can switch data sources without affecting business logic
